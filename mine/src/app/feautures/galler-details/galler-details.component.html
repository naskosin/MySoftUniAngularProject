        <h3>The story</h3>
    <p>
        Fish early, and fish late. Many species of fish bite best right at dawn and dusk, in ambient sunlight. 
        During the mid-day hours cloud cover can make for better fishing, and in direct sunlight (especially during the heat of summer) look for areas with shade. 
        Fish often seek out shade when itâ€™s hot and sunny and become more active during the cool hours of the day, just as you or I might.
